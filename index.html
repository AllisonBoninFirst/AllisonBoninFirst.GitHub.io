    <h2 id="Historyheader">History of Herbalism</h2>
      <p>Herbalism itself is one of the oldest forms of medicine. People have used herbs for thousands of years, relying on things such as powdered supplements teas, and homemade skin creams to help treat everything from skin rashes to mild depression. Herbal supplements, also known as botanicals, are made from the leaves, flowers, roots, and bark of plants.</p>

      <h2 id="Herbalistsheader">Herbalists</h2>
        <p>An herbalist is someone who uses plants for healing. These practitioners are <b>not</b> medical doctors, though some practitioners are also referred to as medical herbalists.</p>
        <h3>What do they do anyway?</h3>
        <p>Herbalists attempt to find the <i>root cause</i> of illness. Practitioners will choose herbs based on the symptoms or ailments a patient describes during the consultation. They will also perform a clinical exam, inspecting certain areas of the body and create a personalized prescription. Patients may use just one herbal treatment or a combination of herbal supplements.</p>
        <h3>Common forms of treatment include:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Tea</li>
          <li>Capsules containing liquids or powdered herbs</li>
          <li>Bath salts</li>
          <li>Oils</li>
          <li>Skin creams and ointments</li>
          <li>Botanicals</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="Educationheader">Education and Training</h2>
          <p>There isn't one common training or certification program for herbalists, which makes their path different from a doctor who attends medical school. Some schools offer graduate-level programs in clinical herbal medicine, where students are encouraged to combine evidence-based science and traditional herbal medicine.</p>
          <h3>The American Herbalist</h3>
            <p>Other organizations, like the American Herbalist Guild (AHG), offer memberships and certifications. The AHG requires 400 hours of training and clinical experience before practitioners can apply for the title of Registered Herbalist.</p>
